We can do that with the `open()` function. You can feed `open()` a file name, or a file location, from the directory where your Python script is. If you give `open()` a '.txt' file, the output will be a long string. For us, it will tend to be more useful to get a list containing each line of the file. That can be done by using `.splitlines()`, like this:\n","\n","```\n",">>> open(\"...\").read().splitlines()\n","```\n","\n","When reading in files, it tends to be good practice to use `with`. This keeps Python from storing the entire file in active memory for the duration of the runtime. This is what that looks like:\n","\n","```\n",">>> with open(\"...\") as file:\n","    x = file.read().splitlines()\n","```\n","\n","It's also possible to read files from a url, but we're not going to worry about that here.\n","\n","Reading files is not something you're going to need to master in this class.
