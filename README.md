<b>LING 193 - F22<br>
This is the my implementation of the auto-correct system<br></b><br>

Big shout out to my instructor - ***Andrew McInnerney***<br>
He led me through every linguistic concepts I learned in Ling 193.<br>
**"Download dictionary"** and **"1st Layer of Correction: Minimum edit distance"** are modefied based on the code from Andrew.

This system will pinpoint misspelled word in a given sentence and then replace it with the most appropriate word from a given dictionary based on “Minimum edit distance”, “Word frequency“, and “Bigrams frequency”.
